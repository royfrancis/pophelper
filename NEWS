pophelper 1.1.9
===========
* 31-May-2016
* For structure files, 'Mean value of alpha' is no longer reported in tabulateRunsStructure(). Reporting of 'Mean value of alpha' and 'Mean value of Fst' may be reimplemented in future if users think it might be be useful.  

pophelper 1.1.8
===========
* 19-May-2016
* In structure files, when more than one line of 'Mean value of alpha' is present, 'mva' was reported as NA. Now, the mean of the values is reported as 'mva'. Thanks to J A Blanco Aguiar for pointing out this issue.

pophelper 1.1.7
===========
* 18-May-2016
* runsToDfStructure() produced NA columns when STRUCTURE file contains probability intervals. Fixed. Thanks to J A Blanco Aguiar for pointing out this issue.  
* plotMultiline() has a new argument sortlabels to show x-axis labels in the original sort order.
* A critical loop variable issue fixed in plotMultiline().  

pophelper 1.1.6
===========
* 02-Jan-2016
* Sort individuals by one or all clusters in plotRuns() or plotMultiline().  
* Subset/reorder populations when using pop labels in plotRuns().  
* runsToDfMatrix(), tabulateRunsMatrix(), summariseRunsMatrix(), clumppExportMatrix() implemented for tabular data.  
* runsToDfAdmixture(), tabulateRunsAdmixture(), summariseRunsAdmixture(), clumppExportAdmixture() deprecated.  
* Argument 'barwidth' deprecated from plotMultiline().  
* Fixed space, labeller for compatibility with ggplot2 2.0.0.  

pophelper 1.1.5
===========
* 18-Oct-2015
* Handling of Admixture files.  
* checkRuns modified to use grepl instead of grep and checks for Admixture files too.
* plotRuns() handles ADMIXTURE files.  
* plotMultiline() handles ADMIXTURE files.  
* plotRunsInterpolate() handles ADMIXTURE files.  
* Code optimisation.  

pophelper 1.1.4
===========
* 27-Sep-2015
* Fixed runsToDfStructure() error when the structure file has 'Estimated Allele Frequencies in each population' rather than 'each cluster'.

pophelper 1.1.3
===========
* 27-Sep-2015
* Error in plotMultiline() with table files corrected.

pophelper 1.1.2
===========
* 17-Sep-2015
* Error fixed in evannoMethodStructure() when using writetable=T.  
Error in vapply(x, format, "", ...) : values must be length 1,
 but FUN(X[[1]]) result is length 6
* Same error fixed in tabulateRunsStructure().  
* Same error fixed in tabulateRunsTess().  
* Same error fixed in summariseRunsStructure().  
* Same error fixed in summariseRunsTess().  
* Error fixed in plotRunsInterpolate().  
Error in theme(legend.key.size = unit(legendsize, "cm")) : 
  could not find function "unit"

pophelper 1.1.1
===========
* 31-Mar-2015
* Function plotRuns() modified.
    + Spacing between bottom plot and second plot was larger than spacing between other plots. This has been corrected.
    + New code to plotting labels
    + Arguments to control label panel height (labpanelheight), spacing between plots (panelspacer), spacing between label area and plots (labspacer).
    + Argument to include or exclude side panels on right side (flab).
    + Argument to include a divider line between populations (flab). Further arguments to modify the divider line.
    + Figure dimensions and conversions have been improved. Old dimension settings (length, height, res etc) may give different plot dimension in this version.
* Internal helper functions for plotRuns() modified.
* Function evannoMethodStructure() modified.
    + Argument doplot is removed. Set plot off using exportplot=F.
    + Argument basesize added to generally control size of figure elements.
    + Conversion between units and dimensions have been modified.

pophelper 1.1.0
===========
* 16-Mar-2015
* Several changes in code to enable faster runtime.
* New HTML vignette created.
* Corrections to NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION
* Function tabulateRunsStructure() modified.
* Function tabulateRunsTess() modified.
* Function summariseRunsStructure() function modified. 2.5x faster.
    + ddply() from plyr() package used to summarise table.
    + na.rm argument added for summarising table. na.rm is passed to min(), max(), mean() and sd() functions.
    + Output table variable order changed. Current column order is loci, ind, k, runs, elpdmean, elpdsd, elpdmin, elpdmax.
* Function summariseRunsTess() function modified.
    + Function ddply() from plyr() package used to summarise table.
    + Output table variable order changed. Current column order is ind, k, runs.
* evannoMethodStructure() has an improved plot theme.
* Function plotRuns() modified.
    + Argument 'labcol' didn't change colour of labels. Fixed.
    + Argument 'pointbgcol' added for background colour of marker points
    + Argument 'linetype' added for changing line type of marker line
* Function analyseRuns() function added. A wrapper for several other functions. Performs a tabulation of runs, summarising of runs, perform Evanno method (for STRUCTURE runs only), exports clumpp output and generates barplots.

pophelper 1.0.4
===========
* 18-May-2014
* Cairo plotting for png exports. Better anti-aliasing.
* fig aspect ratio issue fixed in function plotRunsInterpolate()
* Namespace error resolved for some functions.
* Minor changes to plotRunsInterpolate().
* plotRunsSpatial() function added. STRUCTURE and TESS runs can be used with a coordinate file to spatially plot the points and colour them into clusters based on the highest probability value. The coordinates can be transformed to UTM coordinates for a better spatial representation.

pophelper 1.0.3
===========  
* 11-May-2014
* Function plotRunsInterpolate() added. STRUCTURE and TESS run files can be used with a coordinate file to spatially interpolate clusters using several interpolation methods such as thin splines, inverse distance weighting and kriging.

pophelper 1.0.2
===========  
* 25-Apr-2014
* A bug in functions clumppExportStructure() and clumppExportTess() produced a 'No input' error. This has been fixed. Thanks to Micheal Panasci for pointing this out.

pophelper 1.0.1
===========  
* parameter sorttable added to functions tabulateRunsStructure() and tabulateRunsTess(). Useful if unsorted table is required.

pophelper 1.0.0
===========  
* completed 16-Feb-2014
* the first version of the `pophelper` package
